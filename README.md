# Space-News-2.0
InOrbit, an application that provides information about future space agency missions, bodies in space, meteorites, astronaut spacewalks, and news sourced from The New York Times, The Guardian, and NPR's APIs. 

A heavy overhaul of "Space News," I use my experiences in developing a news aggregator and learning to communicate with REST APIs to create a more refined app, which represents data from a number of sources including: 

The New York Times 
The Guardian 
NPR 
NASA's Near Earth Object Dataset
NASA's Extra-Vehicular Activity Dataset
NASA's Metorite Landing Dataset
LaunchLibrary's API endpoint for Future Space Missions 
"Where is the ISS" for latitude-longitude data to represent in a MapView 
Flickr API for images sourced by NASA
